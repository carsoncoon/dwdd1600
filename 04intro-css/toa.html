        <h1>Toa</h1>
        <p>Toa are a race of heroes who served the Matoran Universe. The powerful beings each wield an Elemental Power and can harness Great Kanohi. In addition to wearing Masks of Power, Toa typically carry Toa Tools, which help channel their Elemental Powers. Most Toa begin their existence as destined Matoran and are transformed into Toa by external means, such as Toa Stones. Once Toa fulfill their destiny, they may choose to relinquish their power for the greater good and become Turaga.</p>
